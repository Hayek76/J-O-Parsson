Retrieving Money velocity data
Here is an example of how you can retrieve the data using Python and the FRED API, and then store it on the IPFS:

import requests
import json
import ipfshttpclient

# Set up FRED API credentials
api_key = 'your-api-key-here'
url = 'https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations'
params = {
    'api_key': api_key,
    'series_id': 'M2V',
    'file_type': 'json'
}

# Retrieve data from FRED API
response = requests.get(url, params=params)
data = json.loads(response.text)

# Connect to IPFS
client = ipfshttpclient.connect('/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001')

# Add data to IPFS
ipfs_data = client.add_json(data)

# Print IPFS hash for the added data
print(ipfs_data['Hash'])

This script retrieves the latest data for the M2V series from the FRED API, converts the response to JSON format, 
and then adds the JSON data to IPFS. The IPFS hash for the added data is then printed to the console.

Once the data is stored on IPFS, you can use it in your Solidity smart contract by reading the IPFS hash and then 
retrieving the data from IPFS. Here is an example of how to do this:

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "ipfs-core/Interface.go";

contract MoneyVelocity {
    InterfaceIPFS public ipfs;

    constructor(address _ipfsAddress) {
        ipfs = InterfaceIPFS(_ipfsAddress);
    }

    function getMoneyVelocity() public view returns (string memory) {
        bytes memory data = ipfs.cat("Qm..."); // replace with IPFS hash of data
        return string(data);
    }
}

This Solidity contract defines a function called getMoneyVelocity that retrieves the data 
from IPFS using the IPFS hash and returns it as a string. The IPFS interface is used to access 
the IPFS node, which is assumed to be deployed at the address specified in the constructor. 
Replace "Qm..." with the IPFS hash of the data that was added using the Python script.
